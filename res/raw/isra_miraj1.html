<span align="justify"><h4>“Rassullah, the Guide of Moslems In The Universe”<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Ladies and gentlemen, as a young generation, we are demanded to increase the development of this country. Nowadays, as we know morality people in this country is decreasing. It can be easily known from the rapidly number of corruptors, sexual violence at under age, robbery, kidnapped at kids and many others. And the most dangerously are these bad behaviour have been done by the well known people such as artist, people in the government, and many others. In other word, young generation have lost their public figure that can be guidance for them. This also would reflect badly on the life of their future.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Ladies and gentlemen, from the illustration above, we know that we need a figure that can change our morality. A figure that can influence our behaviour, from the bad man changed into nice and responsible man. And now the question is “who can be a perfect figure?”. The answer is quiet simple, Rasulullah SAW, the perfect figure that can guide us into the right path.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Ladies and gentlemen, if we are moslems, we believe in Allah as the One Creator and Mohammad is His last and final Messenger. Also, we believe in the Quran and Sunnah as the two main sources of Islam. There are, however, Muslim bunches who deviated from the right path of Islam such as: Shia, Sufi, , etc. So be cautious in knowing who you are dealing with but you have to know that the sects in Islam not like the sects in other religions. <h4></span>
