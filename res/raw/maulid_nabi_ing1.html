<span align="justify"><h4>Assalamualaikum Wr.Wb<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>In the name of Allah, the beneficent and the merciful. All praise be to Allah, the lord of the world, the master of the day after, and the creator of everything in this universe. He has no partner.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Peace and salutations be upon the messenger, Muhammad SAW and his household, and his companions, and his faith full followers who strive in Islam. And I thank to protocol who has given me a time to speak today, entitled “THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD IS A TRUE ROLE MODEL”.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>My beloved brothers and sisters<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Now we should be happy. Just imagine, suppose this event was held just on the day of the birth of our prophet, the incomparable happiness will come over you and me and all of Muslims. And so essentially, this event is a tribute to his birth, the great prophet, the last prophet, and the Seal of the Prophets, Muhammad SAW.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>A noble servant had been sent by Allah, he was born in the elephant year. He became the light in the midst of darkness. He leads us from darkness into the light of life, enhance human morality and straighten any irregularities.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>My beloved brothers and sisters<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>We know that the prophet is a role model, but most of us would prefer to replace him with another position. In fact, who we look up now, mostly, they have strayed from the moral teaching of the prophet. This shows that we are not aware; the prophet is a true role model. Now we already know, and will we still be running in the unconscious? Do you still want to get lost? Don't you interested in the owner of the great moral figure? Are we going to forget our prophet, Muhammad?<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>My beloved brothers and sisters<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca. His mother doesn’t feel any pain when she gave birth. God has instilled the noble qualities or characteristics of prophet hood. The properties of this prophecy are Sidik, Amanah, Tabligh, Fatonah.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>My beloved brothers and sisters<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Prophet Muhammad never lied. What he said was a very precious pearl. Imagine, that we are alive, and Prophet Muhammad is in our midst now, then we should not hesitate to entrust something to him. He always runs the mandate. Not a single verse was unturned to be delivering to his people, and he is really intelligent.<h4></span>

<span align="justify"><h4>My beloved brothers and sisters<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>I think it’s complete enough for me up to this point. The wrong utterance is caused by limitation of my ability and the right one is for Allah.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>May Allah forgive us for our short comings. May Allah reward us for the best of what we have done. At last I say you…<h4></span>
