Commemorating the Day of Kartini

Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.
Prosperous and happy congratulations also goes to our audience and the presence of a religion other than Islam.
On this happy morning, let us reflect and pray together for a moment, hopefully we are up this morning still blessed with happiness by God the Almighty, given the power to give thanks always, the grace and guidance of Almighty God. Gratitude, let us prove to keep running and stay away from the obligation imposed by Allah the Lord is the Most Just.
Furthermore, on this blessed morning, we should also grateful for the opportunity given by God the Almighty God's love, who by his grace we can also jointly held a ceremony commemorating the "Day of Kartini." Kartini's name, is not foreign. Even in this present life had etched an attitude, especially the attitude of the mother, the attitude of the adolescent, who reflects the ideals of the noble mother of Kartini.
As a woman who certainly could not leave his nature as a woman, it now increasingly appears that the fellow seated himself as a warrior nation, has been able to put ourselves Indonesian woman as a fighter who did not want to say number two on the men.
That being assertive women that directly reflect the ideals of Kartini's nobility. That attitude also shows how the Indonesian human rights is addressed. Especially a woman's right to participate in putting yourself to build your nation of Indonesia.
It is not exaggerating if women today are able to talk parallel to the menfolk. Even in our village has a lot of women who rank even higher than some of the brothers. This shows that our nation, especially the women really have realized how important the role and ability of women in upholding the life of the nation, state and society.
We always commemorate Kartini Day every year. But should not at times when we display this warning just reserved for the work and women. But more than that, hopefully every day, every period of the Indonesian women still struggling and still aspire, as a nation that perfumed name.
May God always bless us, especially the women of Indonesia in establishing national and state life. May the glorious women grow, grow strong in keeping the big names of the nation, state, society, and do not forget, may remain victorious in keeping the family name. Amen!
Suffice it used to welcome us all, billahitaufiq walhidayah,
Wassalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.
