<span align="justify"><h4>Assalamu’alaikum wr.wb<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>First of all, let’s say our praise and gratitude only to Allah Swt due to His grace and blessings upon us so that on this good time and occasion we all can still gather in this place in the best of our health.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Ladies, gentlemen, and friends that I love,<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Youth is a figure that always brings alterations. Alteration in life order of some era is quite influenced by the role of youths. In 1982, youths gathered altogether and then took the pledge in order to tighten the unity of Indonesia. This pledge was known as Youth Pledge. All youths from all over Indonesia from various ethnics, cultures, languages, and regions strove for retaking the independence of nation altogether.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Who doesn’t know Mr. Soekarno, our first president of Indonesia? Nobody doubted him in each of his speech to encourage the youths in maintaining the independence of Indonesia. The long journey of Indonesia to the national independence shows us how great the influence was regarding our nation’s life. And then as the youth Muslim generation, what have we contributed to society, nation, religion, and especially our own selves? Have we given any alteration?<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>A Muslim youth should go on with positive alterations day after day in his or her life. How a loss if a Muslim youth is seen to be worse than yesterday. The success of a youth in dealing with a number of life handicaps along with the good alterations will be the basic in how he or she brings alterations to his or her surroundings and those that are bigger than that.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>To all of my companions that I proud of,<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Dr. Yusuf Qardhawi said that there are three things that underlie a youth as a foundation of alteration;<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>1. Youths come with brilliant brain<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>2. Youths have strong physicals<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>3. Youths behave objectively<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>From the three points above, we can come to the conclusion that to bring the balance of physical alterations, youths also need to take into consider of three things that underlie spiritual alterations:<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>1. Youths need to have strong faith<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>2. Youth need to be always istiqamah in performing any religious services and duties<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>3. Youths have good manners or akhlak khasanah<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Ladies, gentlemen, and all the companions blessed by Allah<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>It’s about the time for Muslim youths to rise up for creating alterations in every line of life and keeping as well as maintaining the self-image of Islam. Moreover, Islam has been being besieged from all over the directions. We need to increase our knowledge about Islam by reading various books. Not only Islamic books but also those books whose contents sometimes offense the world of Islam. Thus, youth generations can have the provisions to become the agents of alteration.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Make our youth as the time that’s full of benefits and all the good things before the coming of old age, when all of our spirits would fade away. What are we waiting for, if we can do the alteration now? Use our youth times to become the part of Islam’s awakening history in Indonesia.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>That’s all I could say. I wish we can meet again someday. Please forgive me for the mistakes on my words. Thanks for the attention.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Wassalamu’alaikum. Wr.wb<h4></span>
