<span align="justify"><h4>Assalamu’alaikum Wr. Wb.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Praise be to Allah, the Creator of everything in this universe, lord of the lord, the owner of all mercies that has given them to all mankind without discrimination, believer or unbeliever.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Prayers and regards we should send them to our prophet Muhammad SAW, the simpleman who change the darkness to the clean and ideal life, and the patient man that could spread Islamic law in Arabian and the whole world after his death.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Before stepping to my main speech, I thank the chairman/woman who has given me the chance to deliver my speech.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>My brothers in one faith,<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Imperceptibly, time goes quickly. we have entered the month wrote in this month which had been born a great leader of humanity. leader of the prophets of God who became the light on all light, pinned on him by the title Habibullah is a lover of God, namely Sayyidina wa Maulana Muhammad. Our prophet was born from among the Quraysh with his mother Aminah bint Wahab and his father Abdullah bin Abdul Muthallib. when he was born he had become orphans because when he was still in the womb his father had left him forever.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Prophet Muhammad grew up as prepossessing figure and manners. his height character makes him was given the title of Al Amien is a trustworthy person. This was evident when several tribes will fight the Black Stone laying of stone into ka’ba. they felt that they were the appropriate tribe to put the jewels back into place, then came the Al Amien, then he spread his turban and placed it above ground and over his turban. Then the Prophet Muhammad called for the leaders to hold each end of the turban. then lifted up the stone and placed into position. and ultimately disputes died down and turned into satisfaction and joy that they feel have contributed to the laying of the stone. so how noble morality of our Prophet Muhammad. because the height of his morality, Allah perpetuated in the Qur’an :<h4></span>
<span align="right"><h2>وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلى خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ</h2></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>“And thou truly great virtuous character.” (al-qalam : 4)<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>All audiences whom I love,<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Our duty as the Ummah of the Prophet Muhammad was always emulate his morality, respect the older, love the younger, love one another, the rich embraces the poor, the strong protects the weak. All felt in equality. There is no difference except the faith and piety. A poem states ”Muhammadun basyarun laeisa kal basyar, yaqutatun hajarun wa laeisa kal hajar ” which means that Prophet Muhammad was human but not human beings as well as hyacinth, he is a rock but not a regular rock.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Prophet  Muhammad never hated any of his enemy. He was always forgiving without being asked though. even if he constantly abused by his enemies, he did not have any hatred, he just prayed for his enemies in the guidance given by God Almighty. he envied the glory of the previous Messengers of Allah. the Messenger of Allah wanted him to become one of the Ummah of Prophet Muhammad SAW. because the Ummah of the Prophet Muhammad has the virtue that is not given to the previous ummah. one of them is that later when the Day of Resurrection Allah will give the key to the door of heaven Ummah of the Prophet Muhammad, and the Ummah of the Prophet was Muhammamd is the first time in paradise. really lucky we can be one of the Ummah of the Prophet Muhammad ‘alaihi was salam shalatullah.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>As a proof of love for Allah and His Messenger, Prophet Muhammad, let us together and we follow the Sunnah of the Prophet’s Practice, let us also share our oral habit to read the peace to the Prophet Muhammad, because the Messenger said: “Anyone who reads peace to me one time that God would eliminate evil thereof 10, 10-degree thereof increased, and gave 10 good.”<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>And hopefully we include biting fence sitting with the Messenger of God in heaven one day later, amien.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>My brothers in one faith,<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>I suppose that I must stop my speech. Please, pardon me if you got some mistakes from my speech.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Wabillahitaufiq wal hidayah,<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Wassalamu’alaikum Wr. Wb.<h4></span>
