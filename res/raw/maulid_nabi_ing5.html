<span align="justify"><h4>Assalamu’alaikum wr.wb<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>First of all, let’s say the praise and gratitude to Allah Swt. Salawat and salam may always be upon our adoration and esteemed model, namely Prophet Muhammad Saw, all of his families, companions, and followers.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>We will definitely be very proud if someday we hear the news that those among the graduates of this school have become success people. I wish you could be one of them.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Being success or failed is a choice. It’s you the only one who can choose it. You can observe the choice from the tendency of your heart, the tendency of your mind, and the tendency of your behaviors. The more you dominate and take over the tendencies with positive things, the closer you will be to success. Otherwise, the more you dominate and take over the tendencies with negative things, the more far away you will be to success. All of you will be the proof of what I am saying today to you all.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>For those reasons, I would like to request all of you to turn round soon in order to do positive things for your own good. Look at our paragon, Rasulullah who had been an independent and success person since he was still very young. At age 0 – 4, he had become a fatherless child who lived in the dessert area with Bani Sa’ad (descendants of Sa’ad) and during that time he was breast-fed by Halimah As Sa’diyah. At age 6 – 8, he lived with his grandfather, Abdul Muthalib, who was an authoritative personage. At age 8, he began to herd the goats when living with his uncle, Abu Thalib. At age 12, he began an international business trip to Syria together with his uncle. At age 15, he obtained warfare experience through Fijar War event between Quraisy people and other people for 4 – 5 years long.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>At age 20, he acquired his first diplomatic experience as a pacifying agent between Quraisy people and other kabilah (nomadic tribes) and strengthened his social credibility in society. After that, he worked to Siti Khadijah and got back to take a business trip of exporting and importing to Yamane and Syria.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>At age 25, he married with Siti Khadijah and started out his experience as patriarch. At age 25 – 35, he had had the experiences of being a patriarch, trader, rich man, people’s leader, and in many social activities. Thus, what can we see from the young figure of Prophet Muhammad Saw?<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>I wish all of you could take the wisdom from what I have said. I remind and invite all of you once more, let’s develop the alterations then the success will come close to you.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>That’s all I could convey. Please, forgive me for all the mistakes I made on my words.<h4></span>
<span align="justify"><h4>Wassalamu’alaikum wr.wb<h4></span>
